This directory contains many matroid (-matrix) files distributed with Macek.
The matrix files are designed such that they can be used over any pfield where
they make sense.
Tests for suitability of a pfield are included in the files, and so if you get
arithmetic error(s) while reading a matrix file, it means the current pfield
is unsuitable for reading the matrix.

The names of the files are chosen according to usual symbols denoting the matroids,
mostly following [Oxley].
There are separate subdirectories for matrices of graphs, for generic symbolic 
representations of matroids, and for alternative names/representations of matroids.

A directory with some matroid classes is also included...
