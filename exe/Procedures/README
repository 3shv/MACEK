Here we provide several interesting procedures fur running with Macek.
Some of them are simple, and they are commented as examples in the manual.
Some others are quite complex, and they have been used in real large-scale
matroid computations, run by the author (likewise bw3excg, reprXexc).

Moreover, there are so called "shortcuts" defined in their subdirectory
shortcut/; those are simple command sequences that are mostly used to
demonstrate the possibilities of Macek for first-come users...
(See the introduction parts of the manual for a brief sketch.)
