This is the "execution" subdirectory for the Macek package;
it is supposed to be the current directory from which you run Macek.
A brief introduction to running Macek may be also found here.

The precompiled Macek read-in paths point to the subdirectories
Matrices/ and Procedures/, where some standard input files are stored.
Those include common matroid representations, and some useful procedures
and shortcuts for use with Macek.

By default, the ouput path starts with out/ and temp/ subdirectories here,
where you find your output files stored.
However, those may be changed to your own directory with the -r and -w options.
