			OVERVIEW

This package is a set of tools and routines for reasonably efficient combinatorial
computations with representable matroids, especially for matroid constructions
and for some structural tests.
(If you do not know what a matroid is, then this package is likely not for you.)
The package is intended both to help with everyday routines that a matroid-researcher
faces (almost) every day, and to allow for long exhausted computations of
matroid classes and their properties.

So far, the program deals with matroids represented by matrices over finite fields
and partial fields.
Many common matroids are distributed with the program, and new ones may be easily entered.
An easy manipulation with sets of matroids is supported.
One may pivot the matrices, delete or contract elements, generate (3-connected)
extensions for matrices, and generate/test representations over other fields.
Structural tests for minors, equivalence, isomorphism, etc, are also implemented.
More functions are planned for the future...


			COMPILING

The package can be used on almost any computer platform with the GNU C (gcc)
compiler, relevant C libraries and developement environment, and the basic
set of GNU utilities (at least gmake, flex).
All these required programs are free for anybody -- get them from http://www.gnu.org.
In particular, Linux and other unix-clones, with GNU C developement and GNU
utils installed, would work fine.

First create a subdirectory macek, copy the package archive to it, and
unpack the archive with tar / gzip.
To obtain a current documentation, read the files in the doc subdirectory,
or type 'gmake info' in the top directory.
Then compile the program with 'gmake compile' in the top directory.
You may also run 'gmake all' and/or 'gmake xall' in the src subdirectory,
with the same effect.
Keep in mind that you really have to use the GNU version of make -- gmake,
not the ordinary version.
The result are two executables -- macek and macek.nodebug.


			RUNNING

Run the macek or macek.nodebug executable from the exe subdirectory of the package,
where it is symlinked from.
We also suggest to run the program on a terminal with at least 100 columns,
and better with 132 columns.
Try first to call 'macek -h' to see a simple online help.

Then follow the supplied examples to learn more...
Enjoy!


			DOCUMENTATION

Check the project web-page below for updates to the program and documentation.

If you want to know more about the use of this program, read the info documentation
in the doc subdirectory (or 'make info' at the top).
Read also the file SUPPORTED for the list of "officially" supported platforms,
and the files CHANGELOG and TODO for description of the project history and future.
Read the C-sources if you want to know about the algorithms and implementation of
the Macek project -- start reading in the src/include subdirectory.

The program itself contains a brief command-line help, intended mainly for a quick
reference (option '-h', or '-H' for more help).
