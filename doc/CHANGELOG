			CHANGELOG - HISTORY
		       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.2.12 on  5.12. 2010
	not making a new stable version yet...,
	this is just a poolishing update for new systems,
	changed "ulong" to "unsigned long" in frcoms.c (needed for MacOSX),
	architecture compiler flags, namely "-mtune=native",

1.2.11 on  26.5. 2007
	this is just a small update in documentation,
	and source poolishing for nicer compilation with gcc4 (see FRMAGIC
	and include_stack_ptr).


1.2.09 on  26.8. 2005
	a turn toward a new stabilized version,
	extending struct_connorder_ext() to handle new requests (if cor==NULL),
	correcting frame_getoption_ext() to work with NULL value list,
	changed gener_extframe_ext() to read the connectivity options,
	extending struct_connorder_ext() to record component indices also for rows,
	elimchm_3connsequence() changed to elimchm_xconnsequence() with
	 variable connectivity requirement (0,1,2,3),
	new macro elimchm_connline_ext(),
	substantially changed elimchm_unitline_ext() to unit-scale also
	 disconnected matrices (including referred matrices),
	updated genstep_sequencecheck_ext() for the new connectivity tests
	 (simple/cosimple, or just connected),
	new commands !issimple, !iscosimple (using the implementation of
	 connectivity tests, new struct_simplicity_ext() ),

1.2.02 on  17.7. 2005
		UNSTABLE trial version for non-connected extensions!!!!!!!
	adding ESREQ* flags for controlling connectivity properties of the sequence,
	also in alist.c - alist_setend() length check for long lists changed
	 (which reported fatal error - broken list, for too long lists),

1.2.01 on  12.5. 2005
	slight updates in the manual (a note on matrix representations),
	

1.2 on  16.3. 2005
	final source poolishing...
	 two types of new warning messages from gcc 3.4 have been eliminated:
	 - use of compound (,,) expressions as lvalues in some macros has been rearranged,
	 - warning on "operation ... may be undefined" was caused by multiple-expansion
	   of debug-checking code inside some macros, so that has been eliminated
	   wherever possible,
	 another warning "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules"
	  remains there (in the nodebug version), but does it mean anything important?
	
	adding an option -s/S for a safe execution mode - restricting !ifshell,
	 and forbidding bad directory names, not allowing to overwrite files
	 (depending on path?), changes in fopen_dir() and new fopen_safename(),
	 all these changes are implemented in the starting code, in the file-openning
	 functions (include the use of file paths), and in the handle for !ifshell,
	enlarging the allocation bound for matrix recycling, other hard bounds,
	
	manual updates and poolishing, describing !minorusi, remarks on the new functions
	 that they are from 1.2, and not quite efficient yet,
	poolishing also the distributed examples - shortcuts now have better structure
	 and simple built-in help, demonstration procedures are commented and prepared
	 to handle unusual situations (&splitlist, &reprXexc, &bw3excg),


	This is the end of the second stage of development.
	We are releasing VERSION 1.2 !!!
========

1.1.99999 on  5.11. 2004
	added !minorusi - testing for a minor using a specified element id,
	a stupid little bug was found in struct_minorbyrem_() with deleting/contracting
	 coloops/loops, resulted in occasional "Program ERROR: wrong removal submatrix size"
	 messages which did not affect correctness of the computation,
	 this bug exists already from 0.9 version(!!!), but it is harmless,

1.1.9999 on  11.5. 2004
	corrected frame_copy_ext() to copy also the matrix pfield index,
	corrected frame_inputmatrix_ext() to report an error when an input matrix
	 is over a different pfield,
	added a command '!iffile' testing for readability of the given file within
	 Macek search paths,
	added commands !prbases and !prcircuits for printing all bases or
	 all circuits of a matroid, one can request elements in them,
	added an option -T for printing 4-digit time in output messages, or time
	 in minutes or hours,
	added command '!isconni4', updated manual to include the new commands,

1.1.999 on  20.12. 2003
	corrected a syntax problem with '/' on short subframe input lines,
	explicitly forbidding input from non-regular files (does not apply to symlinks),
	new clear handling of the option '@inputpf XX' -- the switched pfield applies
	 ONLY to input scanning in the current frame and its subframes, but not at all
	 to command processing (use '!pfield XX' for that),
	changed name to "%sR%d" for generated representations of a matroid,
	the feature of an "extension prefix" from 1.1.9 introduced an unfortunate error for
	 extending certain matrices over partial fields - but all occurences of this error
	 were reported by the internal self-test ("No induced connecting path found..."),
	this error did not affect extensions over fields since the leading-unit test was
	 still applied after, and the connecting paths were not used for fields,
	this error is now repaired - when scaling to get the leading nonzero in the
	 extended matrix line, one cannot determine the unit in advance, but the line must
	 be scaled afterwards because of strange connected orders of rows...
	some updates of internal checks in stcheck.c (disabling for binaryonly, etc.),
	a new self-check for representations of F7 versus characteristic 2,
	debug-printing update in pfield_arithmetic_ext(),
	connectivity computation in struct_connectivity_ext() updated to handle an extension
	 to internal connectivity, this is now used only in !prmore,
	another bug in computing girth - actually caused by an incorrect handling of the
	 mins parameter to ematrix_submatrices_ext(); in fact only affecting some calls to
	 ematrix_submatrices_sub(e,k) for large k, that fortunately did not affect the
	 important computation of strmag_flatlines() thanks to the condition k<=co there,
	so only the large girth computation was sometimes affected (with an error message),
	 and that is now fully corrected,
	
1.1.99 on  16.9. 2003
	preparing a release-candidate for version 1.2...,
	change @ext-entries which may now be given with more then one param on a line,
	corrected the procedure producing unit-leading extension vectors so
	 that the coordinates are taken in order by rows, not by connectivity
	 (needed for correct function of @ext-entries),
	few updates in documentation,

1.1.9 on  25.7. 2003
	now we freeze functionality development on the way to version 1.2,
	updating file-related functions in misc.c, better code and docs,
	proper handling of the search path for writing,
	new command-line options ... -t, -r,-R, -w, -x, see in main/*,
	using -t- to disable all autosave,
	enhance !setname to handle multiple frames with numbering by "%d",
	new command !msize for filtering frames with matrices with specified size,
	basic updates in the Macek manual 1.1 with the new functions,
	still one new function on request - an option @ext-entries "..."
	 forces to generate only extension lines starting with "...",

1.1.6 on  1.7. 2003
	implementing !writecom - writing one frame with additional matroidal comments,
	printing representability over small fields for !printmore and !writecom,
	small changes in !printmore output format,
	new command variants for extensions -- !extendto, !extendrow/col,
	adding tests of new structural commands from 1.1 to stcheck.c,
	implementing command '!mark',

1.1.5 on  5.6. 2003
	printed output enhancement - long frame trees are not printed in whole,
	but middle repeated sons are skipped, also writing foot comment for frame file,
	implemented shortest cycle (girth) brute-force computation in strconn.c,
	new commands !girth, !hasgirth, printing girth also in !printmore,
	special version !ispaving with modified printing,
	implementing automorphism orbits for !printmore, using a modification
	 of the isomorphism testing code with element "labels",
	updates in !printmore, including printed aut orbits for matroids,
	

1.1.4 on  10.4. 2003
	fixed a small bug in '@inputpf XX' implementation - must set FRPFINDEX,
	enlarged GEN_MAXMATEXTENS internal bound, change adding shorter lines in
	grepr_generate_ext() to restrict number of free extensions,
	another bug in representability test - say no error for undefined subdeterminants,
	and a new bug in isomorphism test for different pfields - must switch
	pfields when computing flatlines,
	changed to ematrix_copy_notr() before ematrix_resetid() in isomorphism
	and tight-major tests,

1.1.3 on  15.3. 2003
	found an ERROR with generating "bbb"-steps from U25 in GF4,GF5 vs. in Gmean!
	(looks like a problem with isomorphism testing - going to trace down),
	plus some updates in printing results of command handles,
	the error was caused by a typo in strmag_flatlines_ext() - wrong corank
	 bound on k, which probably did not affect other stuff (equiv etc.),
	 corrected now... (was NOT present in 1.0 line!)

1.1.2 on  9.3. 2003
	implemented the command handles for representability test and generating
	 representations (!repres, !represgen), tested these,
	implemented new commands !ifshell, !mread,

1.1.1 on  25.2. 2003
	implemented an easy representability test for matroids (using parts of
	 the extension generating code, not much efficient),
	all in gener/grepres.c,
	debug-testing that code against theory results (like dyadic vs GF3,GF5)...
	still needs to add a correct command handle(s) for representability,
	 and a faster grepr_isrepresented() implementation,

1.1.0 on  20.2. 2003
	allowed handling different pfields in one list of frames - FCPAR_LISTFRMP0,
	used now in printing and in an isomorphism test,
	impemented structural test for abstract matroid isomorphism - in strmag.c,
	this uses a new function comparing all subdeterminants in ematexp.c,
	
	implementing a command handle for isomorphism, updating the command handle
	for equivalence to properly handle uniqueness in one matrix list,
	minor updates in the equivalence testing code,
	-> commands !isomorph, !isompair,
	debug-testing these additions... (seem to work fine)

	New development line is starting - more structural commands, and
	some almost-abstract matroid handling...
========


1.0.2 on  10.2. 2003
	corrected few minor bugs with '!append': appending more commands,
	wrong matrix entries in append,
	syntax error with the '>' character in '!iflist',

1.0.1 on  29.1. 2003
	added few more finite fields,
	updated sources for GCC 3.2 (Linux RedHat 8.0), still need to remove some warnings,

1.0 on  19.8. 2002
	final source poolishing...

	This is the end of the first stage of development.
	We are releasing VERSION 1.0 !!!
========


0.99.3 on  7.8. 2002
	corrected stupid bugs in ematrix_printmore_flats() (missing sizeof, wrong indexing),

0.99.2 on  5.8. 2002
	really close to the final release 1.0!
	minor updates in ematrix_printmore_(), cleaning old sources and makefiles,
	adding BINARYONLY version (faster for binary),

0.99.1 on  31.7. 2002
	approaching 1.0 ...
	but still few bugs - wrong "Incorrectly printed number" error message removed,
	an even power must give a positive result in pfield_arithmetic(),
	corrected '-a' printing in near-regular, missing lists found in gcanon_dispseqtest(),

0.9.8 on  27.7. 2002
	enabled canonical check at level 2 -> faster,
	added possibility of unordered addition of lines of the same type in
	 cannonical check - see GEN_SUBSEQUNORD, now much faster for long sequences,
	preferred successful minors in frcom_minorlist() for faster test,
	fixed wrong parameter reading in frame_getparamfr_list(),
	command !eqpair, transferred the tight-major code and added printing for !tmajor,
	enabled self-maps recycling (but not for bases),
	checked the fan code plus printing, corrected self-maps recycling - respect tr,
	freed lost matrices in recycling icsave[],
	corrected (left-bracket) error in the input arithmetic stack,
	changed reading/printing pfield numbers - no more confusing atoms like "-a-1",

0.9.7 on  15.7. 2002
	moving towards next stable release...
	corrected nasty error in the new equivalence code - magic values when transposing,
	finished the new generating code, repaired minor bugs in it,
	rewrote code choosing leading 1 in gmatext.c, adjusted output printing,
	deprecated options/commands, some command updates and renaming,
	corrected printing of matroid flats, updated debug tests for new functions,
	stupid bug with rank in connectivity,

0.9.6 on  9.7. 2002
	starting work on extension generating code, first in gmatext.c,
	additional connectivity code, two- and three-dim array allocation,
	finished new gmatext.c code,
	minor uodates elimseq.c, including 3-conn checks,
	rewrite gener.c, respecting matrix id's when extending, ctrl parameter,
	updates in genstep.c - mainly canonical check,

0.9.5 on  31.5. 2002
	updated ematrix_getbases_ext() to generate bases by given line codes,
	generating "flatline" magic numbers for matroids (matroid invariant for equivalence),
	faster equivalence implementation, more debug tests in line maps,
	finished new strminor.c code, still lacks minor statistics...

0.9.4 on  28.4. 2002
	general function allowing recycling of arbitrary lists (in misc/),
	generalizing matrix "automoprhisms" to injective line maps between two matrices,
	line maps on fixed rows, update in struct_connorder() to finish even disconnected,
	line maps with the same number of columns, all line maps by subsets of columns,
	rewriting matroid minors using the above functions,
	the new line-map and minor code seems to be correct now, tested well,
	but something still needs to be finished for faster computing
	 - strmap_allbyorder_ext(), struct_hasminorlist_ext() options, minor statistics...

0.9.3 on  18.4. 2002
	starting to work on a new shape of the struct/ subdirectory:
	 - introducing connectivity testing, and "magic values" for matrices and matroids,
	functions for connected order and connectivity, commands !isconn, !connectivity,
	updating ematrix_union_ext(), checking disjoint submatrices,
	new alist_ code, faster and more clear, checked OK,
	new branch-width-3 implementation, now with printed output,
	added "bounded" rank and separation computations,
	new faster code for matrix closure,

0.9.2 on  14.4. 2002
	fixed few small errors from 0.9.1,
	using new code to generate bases, and to list flats and separations in printmore(),
	the overhaul of ematrix/* is almost completed now...

0.9.1 on  3.4. 2002
	some profiling in pfield (macros for work with exponents),
	fixed stupid memleak in ematrix_copydual(),
	some speed-ups in ematrix.c, new determinant code in ematrixop.c,
	generating all submatrices in a separate function, using elsewhere...,
	faster inpfield test, what about the new randomized version - good?,
	

	we are going to update some of the basic matrix handling routines
	to allow for easy search through all submatrices and all separations
	 (exponentially long computations concentrated in a new file ematexp.c),
	that would then allow for faster equivalence and minor testing when
	using magic values computed from small-rank flats (which is polynomial!),
	...
========


0.8.2 on  1.4. 2002
	added printing all displayed minors (ch==-2 in dispmin),

0.8.1 on  25.3. 2002
	resolve cycled symbol replacements on matrix lines,
	add command '!unique', update documentation,

0.8.0 on  22.3. 2002
	stable release, already suitable for first publication,
	corrected '= matrix line' recognition,
	added golden mean partial field,
	

	we close the 0.7.x developement line, but several things are still missing
	on the way to 1.0...
========


0.7.6 on  3.3. 2002
	commands !mmove, !restart, !exit, !skip, !iflist (command-flow control),
	option @inputpf,

0.7.5 on  25.2. 2002
	stupid - flex really does not close input files, must close by hand,
	new options @erase, @eraseall,
	implementing command !printmore for printing matroid-invariants like bases, flats,
	 etc, this still needs correct implementation of the flats,
	command !mhash for determining matroid-invariant hash-value for a frame,
	writing frames to a common subdirectory prefix,

0.7.4 on  18.2. 2002
	changing $N old result addressing to ~N and ^N (keep and delete type),
	enhancing naming scheme for commands with list-parameters,
	fake use of debug variables in macek.nodebug to avoid warnings,
	allow $macro processing on the beginning of a line (only if a syntax error otherwise),
	
0.7.3 on  10.2. 2002
	some source structure changes,
	allowing FCRET_REPLMXL for !dual (and other commands...),
	finishing (almost) the info documentation,

0.7.2 on  27.1. 2002
	making frame_processcommands() re-entrant - problems with static variables,
	command '!read', some code cleaning,
	more work on the manual -- now almost complete for an initial release,

0.7.1 on  22.1. 2002
	new general tree-processing function for frames, new FCRET_REPLMXL return type,
	new commands '!append', '!flatten', '!pfield', '!import', ...
	work with multiple pfields, pfield translations for matrices,
	deleting commands after execution,

0.7.0 on  10.1. 2002
	some updates of the "magic" test in the ematrix structure,
	enhanced printing of frame commands (verbosity levels),
	change naming of frames and extracted matrices in commands,
	freeing the list qel with the structures in gener_extframe_ext(),
	writing info documentation (user-level) for the whole program,
	
	starting a new developement line, but no important changes are planned...
========


0.6.4 on  2.12. 2001
	fixing some bugs (inpfile in emflexsup.c, wrong condition in bw-3 testing,
	 undefined 2x2 subdeterminants after using pfield endomorphism in strmin.c),
	added "@extinherit??" for inheritance in extensions,
	preventing selected options from being written (sub-par*, transpose),
	added program-start consistency tests (including structural and generating),
	added "@repl-PF X x" for replacing in specific pfields,

0.6.3 on 28.11. 2001
	implementing "$macro" substitutions for option and command values and include names
	 (values given by "@sub-XXX xxx", default values "@subd-XXX xxx"),
	this is also used to implement "&procedure param1 .." calls to include file
	 "procedure" with additional commands, getting the parameters as macros,
	changing the "<{ }"-incude shortcut to a subframe shortcut like "{ { } { } }"
	 - a cleaner solution,
	reducing some repeated error messages,
	changing special-line replacements (",;"->" \n") to a new handling,

0.6.2 on 22.11. 2001
	final polishing of the converted code,
	updates of command-line capabilities (short help for the program, and for
	options, commands, pfields, frames),
	not to print error message for empty input list, just warning,
	some updates in command handling functions, protect from empty input,
	no exit after input scanning error, return NULL frame instead, reduce subsequent errors,

0.6.1 on 21.11. 2001
	implemented testing branch-width 3 for 3-connected matroids, seems OK,
	computing binary excluded minor for bw-3 (takes quite long - large minors),
	command parameters - address by frame name,

0.6.0 on 20.11. 2001
	first successfull conversion of the whole generating code into the new framework,
	no, the version should be 0.6.x, not 0.60.x....

========


0.59.9 on 18.11. 2001
	converting the extension-generating code...,
	creating an interface for third-party includes in the generating code,
	conversion of a frame (with specific "ext-" options) to an elimination sequence,
	tested for some known dyadic extensions... OK
	
0.59.8 on 17.11. 2001
	analyzer fixes with empty comment lines, and expr replacement length,
	the whole struct-part of the program is now converted to the new scheme,
	so many structural tests are now available,
	fan-testing now works even when not 3-connected,
	described the problems with non-equivalent representations when looking
	for matroid-minors (unlabeled strong equivalence),
	first try to program testing for branchwidth 3, but not correct yet,

0.59.7 on 15.11. 2001
	progress on converting the old-program computation to the new command handling model,
	some changes in the analyzer (like handling commands inside the subframe-include list,
	 disposing double quotas from expressions),
	to null the exponent for a standard form of 0, more checks in pfield arithmetic,
	debug output with verbosity levels(???),

0.59.6 on 10.11. 2001
	command handling is now written (with general parameter and result descriptions),
	this includes also file-reading and writing of frames,
	minor fixes in the analyzer code and in the alist implementation,
	
0.59.5 on 4.11. 2001
	reading frames (and subframes), matrices, options, commands now all OK,
	also implemented options "replace" and "require" that change the way
	matrix is read from the input,
	cleaning the analyzer code, fixing minor problems with scanning,
	going to implement general command (and parameter) handling...
	
0.59.4 on 31.10. 2001
	first implementation of input frames (and subframes),
	adapted the lexical scanner to handle subframes,
	matrix reading OK, going to implement option handling,

0.59.3 on 29.10. 2001
	finished and tested input of an arbitrary pfield expression in the lexical scanner,
	working on implementing options, commands, subframes and includes in the scanner,
	
0.59.2 on 27.10. 2001
	completely new source structure, new makefiles,
	continuing conversion to a general matroid-computation tool,
	pfield implementation finished, first lexical scanner of input matrices,

0.59.1 on 13.10. 2001
	few updates of command-line capabilities + related functions...
	also fixed a nasty error with the tt-cycle when looking for all fans (not-lastline version)

0.5.9 on 29.7. 2001
	starting to implement other pfields, using a fixed number of exponents
	and a list of fundamental elements to perform computations...

	(cut-off: no longer a special program for computing dyadic matroids...)
========


0.5.3 on 3.7. 2001
	implement checking for 3-tails, just a small addition, also code for closures
	and full closures needed there,

0.5.2 on 24.6. 2001
	mainly documentation updates, closing one section of developement...

0.5.1 on 21.6. 2001
	major speed-ups for the dispminor code (which was wasting most time so far),
	much faster than the previous code, and still seems to be correct,

0.5.0 on 17.6. 2001
	first version properly computing dyadic (co)extensions,
	with corrected fan-checking,
	adapted also for solaris and osf,

========

pre-0.5 (20.4. - 16.6. 2001)
	hard developement... (no records available now)
