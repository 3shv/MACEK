3.12.2010:  This file is obsolete (for many years already) since all
development of MACEK has stopped...


                               TODO list for MACEK
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(last updated 9.6. 2006)



comments like //**** in the source usually mean some unfinished business
	(working fine, but can be done better, faster, etc)


actual:
	- 
	- static library version (quiet?), with a copied interface...
	- "quiet" compile version - only the plain output printed,
		additional to stderr (if other stream) !!!!!!!
	- 
	- what implements ESCONNECT without requirements??? (new -1 value???)
	- when generating with ctrl, remove the word 'non-equiv' from OUTPUT!!!
	- add a note on ext-forbid in the OUTPUT...
	- !extendsize with <=r <=c bounds...
	- 
	- check input sequence connectivity in gener_extframe_ext()...
	- input sequence connectivity should check also simple/cosimple!!!
	- completly separate "frame" code from working functions!!!
	- 
	- emflexsup.c: include_stack_ptr non-static (needed for debug),
	- not use ulong in frcoms.c, (typedef unsigned long ulong;) better NOT
	- 
	- update all program documentation about 3-connectivity !!! (and also 3conn...)
	- change sequence connectivity messages, like `Remark: The extension
		generating process requires one to start from a sufficiently
	  "3-connected" matroid, and it cannot work for an arbitrary matroid by its nature.'
	- 
	- 
	- new debug self-tests!!!!!!!!


program interface :
	- setting some command-line options of Macek also from the environment,
	- a command moving (not copying) a whole frame subtree?
	- matrices P8','', others from Oxley???, more graphs??
	- 


program code :
	- correct '!append' of two more matrix lines (number of columns?)
	- handling ^C signal - save the frame tree before termination,
	- make !minorusi code more efficient - directly inside minor testing,
	- the new (1.1.x) structural code - isomorphism, representability,
	   need another audit and profiling to efficiency,
	- faster special implementation of grepr_isrepresented() - i.e. only testing...
	- in (disconn) extension generation - handle matrices with very many
	   self-maps (identical entries in the matrix)...., how?
	- 


program functions :
	- command for printing separations up to k ???
	- update matroid hash value - use flatlines, cycles, etc...
		version 2.0 !!!  make smaller values??
	- 


memory allocations :
	- should be OK now, no visible leaks...
	- remove hard allocation bounds on demand? - change defines in Makefile...
	- why lists are "broken" (error message) when memory is exhausted?
		- repaired in alist_setend() !?!?
	- 


debug (self-)tests :
	- add a recursive self-test for ez!=NULL in gener_matextens_ext()...
	- start-up checks for !minorusi ... (after coded in the structural functions)
	- other new commands??
	- self-tests for disconnected generation...
	- 


documentation
	- more examples at the end, proving correctness of computation...
	- update papers in the manual (plus aacc)
	- refer to a new "algebraic" enumeration with Martin...
	- 
	- comment the available file-naming schemes when writing more than
	  one file at once
	-
