 The program requires GNU C compiler, GNU make, Flex, and a Bash-style shell.
 (Get them all from http://www.gnu.org .)
 And, of course, the program needs a user with good knowledge of matroids...
 
 Unpack with tar/gzip into a separate subdirectory.
 (Call them like "gtar xzf Macek_....tar.gz".)
 Read "make help", or "make info" for more help.
 Go to "src" and "make all", or/and "make xall".
 Switch to "exe", run "./macek" or"./macek.nodebug".
 Follow the manual intro in "doc/" or the file "Examples".
 Enjoy!

 Read the documentation files and the pdf manual in "doc/".
 If you want to know more, then read the sources.
 Again - you really need GNU make (or gmake) and GNU cc (or gcc),
 not the old-fashioned-unix versions!
