		   ( "MAtroids Computed Efficiently" Kit )

A set of tools and routines for reasonably efficient combinatorial computations with
representable matroids, especially for matroid constructions and for structural tests.
(If you do not know what a matroid is, then this package is likely not for you.)
The package provides a standalone command-line oriented executable, suitable
also for batch jobs, an online graphic trial interface from the web page,
and newly some static libraries for wrapping into other packages.
