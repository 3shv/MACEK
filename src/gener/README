This directory contains source files relevant to generating
non-equivalent matrix extensions (i.e. elimination sequences).
(Read more in ../include/gener.h, gen.h .)
Additional tests for the elimination sequence should be written into gener-more.inc .

Moreover, the extension code is now used also for generating representations over
another pfields. (Simple, but not much efficient implementation.)
