FRAME - geneal input entity - 
	may hold a matrix or a set of frames,
	contains arbitrary options,
	may have associated commands,

syntax:
	- comment lines (# or %, include the newline),
	- matrix lines (start with blank, or number 0,1),
	- option lines (start with @ or 'option'),
	- command lines (start with ! or 'command', or & for procedures),
	- include lines (start with < or 'include'),
	- sub-frame line (start with SUBFR, end with EOFR),
	- include line with names in {} reads subframes (a shortcut).
	
  special - on the top level (given string);
	all lines starting with a number are matrix lines,
	all words starting with a letter are include names,
	and all ',' are replaced by space, all ';' are replaced by newline
	 - replacement in the string before calling lex

options:
	- affect the frame immediately (like @replace...)
	- inherited from parent frames (up to some exceptions),
	- possible to retrieve the last option value, or all values
	  (both returned as a list, but "all values" do not handle numeric options...)
	-
